# gwent-clone

This is a project from more than a year ago. I tried to create my own Gwent clone using Java/LWJGL.
I created this repo for anyone who is interested in the source code.
WARNING: This repo does not include the game assetes (textures, fonts, ...) and you will not be able to play it if you download this.
Why? Because I don't have copyright for those resources.

This project uses a modified version of the Slick2D game library.
